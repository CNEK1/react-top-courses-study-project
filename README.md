# Features
## User Authentication
Users can create an account on the application by registering with their email and password. Once they have an account, they can log in to access the application's features.

## Admin Dashboard
The admin dashboard provides a way for administrators to manage the content of the application. From the dashboard, administrators can add new materials, manage existing materials, and view user orders. However, this feature is still under development and may not be fully functional.

## Reviews
Users can leave reviews on materials they have used in the application. These reviews are visible to all users and can help them decide which materials to use. However, the review validation feature is still under development.

## User Orders
Users can view their order history in the application. This feature allows users to keep track of the materials they have purchased and access them again if needed. However, the shopping menu is still under development.
